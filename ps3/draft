zhttptta: a higher performance web server

===skeleton draft===

goal
* lower average response time
* enlarge server capacity

approach
* buffer
* priority scheduling (SPRT ...)

Problem 1: mutex for safe counter


Problem 2: study several scheduling methods (round-robin, FIFO, LIFO, SPRT ...)


Problem 3: [code work] implement your preferred scheduling in zhttpta (in user space but not kernel)


Problem 4: [code work] reduce the memory footprint when serving large file downloading


Problem 5: [code work] integrate gash in zhttpa, how would you schedule the connection to gash?


Problem 6: [use the provided test tool]test and compare zhttpta with zhttpto, any performance improvement?
C10k problem
Web Server Performance Comparison: http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Web_Server_Performance_Comparison
ab - Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool

maybe not good. Problem 7: Mordern solution for serving static files (non-blocking evented I/O (e.g. Tornado)? CDN? what else?)
non-blocking, asynchronous, event driven I/O
