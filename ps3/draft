zhttpta: a higher performance web server

===skeleton draft===

goal
* lower average response time
* enlarge server capacity

approach
* buffer
* priority scheduling (SPRT ...)


Problem 1: [code work] reduce the memory footprint when serving large file downloading


Problem 2: study several scheduling methods (round-robin, FIFO, LIFO, SPRT ...)


Problem 3: [code work] implement your preferred scheduling in zhttpta (in user space but not kernel)


Problem 4: [maybe code work, or use the provided test tool?]test and compare zhttpta with zhttpto, any performance improvement?


Problem 5: Mordern solution for serving static files (CDN? what else?)


Problem 6: [code work] integrate gash in zhttpa, how would you schedule the connection to gash?
