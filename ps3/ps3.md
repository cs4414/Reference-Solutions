## Purpose

The goals of this assignment are to:

- Learn about job scheduling policies and their applicability to a variety of scenes.

- Understand how to optimize the performance of application by implementing a simple web server.


**Collaboration Policy.** For this problem set, you are expected to
work with one other student in the class.  You may select your own
partner (but will be required to work with someone else on the next
assignment).  If you don't already have a partner, use the [Piazza
forum](https://piazza.com/virginia/fall2013/cs4414).

You and your partner should work together in a way that is efficient and
collaborative, and ensures that both of you understand everything in the
code you submit.  You could choose to use [pair
programing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) if you want,
but it is also fine to discuss together a plan for the assignment, work
independently on different parts of the project, then explain and do
code reviews on each others work after.

As part of the grading for this assignment, you will be a short demo
with one of the course staff, and both partners will be expected to be
able to answer questions about how your code works.

Please note that only one of you need to create the private repository
for this problem set, the other member should work in the same
repository as a collaborator.

In addition to working directly with your partner, you should feel free
to discuss the problems, provide coding help, and ask for help with any
students in the class (or anyone else in the world, for that matter), so
long as you don't to it in a way that is detrimental to your own or
anyone else's learning.  You can do this in person, using the Piazza
forum, using the `#cs4414` and `#rust` IRC channels, or any other
communication medium you find most effective.


# Getting Started

Before continuing with this assignment, you should find a teammate and 
**one of you** should:

1. Set up the private repository named 'cs4414-ps3'.
2. Add your teammate and 'cs4414uva' as the collaborators.
3. Clone the empty private repository to your working environment. Instead of _mygithubname_ below, use your github username.

```text
    git clone https://github.com/mygithubname/cs4414-ps3.git
```

4. Get the starting code for ps3.  
	
```text
    git remote add course https://github.com/cs4414/ps3.git
    git pull course master
    git push --tags origin master
```
 
After finishing these steps, everyone in the team should have access to your own `cs4414-ps3` 
repository that contains starting code for ps3.
